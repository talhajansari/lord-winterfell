			 		Talha'a rather unorthodox take on life has placed him at an interesting position. Four months out of college, where he majored in physics and economics, he is working (not for long) as a technology developer at HBO Inc., but is excited about the challenges of working in a startup, is passionate about scientific research, and spends his free time learning Mandarin (and building not-so-impressive websites). However, he sometimes does fear that if he doesn't get his passions straight, no girl will ever take him (#SadStoryOfDesiBoys).
			 		<br>
			 		<br>
			 		Talha's research interests lie at the intersection of electronics, computers, physics, economics, and culture. He dreams of oneday being able to combine all these disciplines into a hotchpocth, and be a Professor of Hotchpotch Studies. Until then, he is excited about his research on lock-in amplifiers, which he did during his Physics thesis, and finds interests in many other exciting research topics including photonics, biomedical imaging, and plasma engineering.

			 		Talha graduated from Middlebury College, VT, in 2012 with a B.A. in Physics and Economics. Find out more about his research on <a href="research/index.html">lock-in amplifiers</a>, or <a href="contact_me.html">contact him</a> for more information.
