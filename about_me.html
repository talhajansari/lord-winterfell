		 	<p>Talha'a rather unorthodox take on life has placed him at a unique position. Just four months out of college, where he majored in physics and economics, he is now employed (not for long) as a technology developer at HBO Inc., is excited about the challenges of working in a startup, is passionate about scientific research, and spends his free time learning Mandarin (and building not-so-impressive websites). However, he sometimes does fear that if he doesn't get his passions straight, no girl will ever take him (#SadStoryOfaDesiBoy). </p>

		 	<p>Talha's research interests, like him, lie at the intersection of electronics, computers, physics, economics, and culture. He dreams of oneday being able to combine all these disciplines into a hotchpocth, and be a Professor of Hotchpotch studies. Until then, he is excited about his research on lock-in amplifiers, which he did during his Physics thesis, and finds interest in many exciting other research topics including photonics, biomedical imaging, and plasma engineering. </p>

		 	<p> Talha graduated from Middlebury College, VT, in 2012 with a B.A. in Physics and Economics. Find out more about his research on <a href="research/index.html">lock-in amplifiers</a>, or <a href="contact_me.html">contact him</a> for more information about him. </p>
